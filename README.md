# Marvel-Future-Fight-Teambuilding-Accessory
A program to help newer Marvel Future Fight players build the best team possible. Not up to date.  

Functional gamemodes: World Boss, Dimension Mission, Dimension Rift, Story Mode, and Epic Quest. All others will not work if you try them.  

Main code file is MFF_teambuilding. toons is the directory of characters and their abilities, which I didn't feel like putting in the main file since it is just a block of text.
